To create a comprehensive GitHub README file for your project "Customized Virtual File System (CVFS)", I will review the content of the provided `CVFS.cpp` file. This will help me understand the key features and functionality of your project.

Let's start by examining the `CVFS.cpp` file to extract relevant details. I'll read the file and analyze its content.

Based on the initial review of the `CVFS.cpp` file, the project involves creating a Customized Virtual File System (CVFS) to understand file system internals. The file contains various structures and functions for managing inodes, superblocks, file tables, and user file descriptor tables (UFDT). It also includes a `man` function to display command descriptions and usage.

Here's a draft for the README file:

# Customized Virtual File System (CVFS)

## Overview

The Customized Virtual File System (CVFS) project is designed to simulate the behavior of a file system, providing an educational tool to understand file system internals. This project allows the creation, management, and manipulation of files within a virtualized environment, helping users comprehend how file systems handle files, inodes, and related structures.

## Features

- **Inode Management:** Create and manage inodes for different files.
- **File Operations:** Support for basic file operations such as create, read, write, and delete.
- **File Permissions:** Implement file permissions to control access levels.
- **Command Support:** Various commands to interact with the virtual file system, with descriptions available via the `man` function.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ libraries

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CVFS.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd CVFS
    ```
3. Compile the code:
    ```sh
    g++ CVFS.cpp -o cvfs
    ```

### Usage

Run the compiled executable:
```sh
./cvfs
```

### Commands

- **create:** Create a new regular file.
  ```sh
  create <File_name> <Permission>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  create testfile 1
  ```

- **read:** Read data from a regular file.
  ```sh
  read <File_name> <No_of_Bytes_To_Read>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  read testfile 100
  ```

- **write:** Write data to a regular file.
  ```sh
  write <File_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  write testfile
  ```

- **delete:** Delete a file.
  ```sh
  delete <File_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  delete testfile
  ```

### Project Structure

- **`CVFS.cpp`**: The main source file containing the implementation of the virtual file system.
